<h3>Ocean turtle names</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leatherback_sea_turtle" target="_blank">Leatherback sea turtle</a></li>
	<p><b>he leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), sometimes called the lute turtle or leathery turtle or simply the luth, is the largest of all living turtles and the heaviest non-crocodilian reptile, reaching lengths of up to 2 metres and weights of 600 kg.[5][6] It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell; instead, its carapace is covered by oily flesh and flexible, leather-like skin, for which it is named.[7]

	<p><b>The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm (35 in) in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg (298 lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg (1,000 lb). The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.</b></p>

	<p><b>The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle,[4] is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.[5] Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.[6][7] The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black</b></p>

<h3>Land turtle names</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle" target="_blank">Box turtle</a></li>
	<p><b>Box turtles are North American turtles of the genus Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to tortoises in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The 12 taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over six species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to retract its head and legs and close its shell tightly to protect itself from predators.</b></p>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_tortoise" target="_blank">Gopher tortoise</a></li>
	<p><b>The gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is a species of tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is native to the southeastern United States. The gopher tortoise is seen as a keystone species because it digs burrows that provide shelter for at least 360 other animal species. G. polyphemus is threatened by predation and habitat destruction.

The gopher tortoise is a representative of the genus Gopherus, which contains the only tortoises native to North America. The gopher tortoise is the state reptile of Georgia and the state tortoise of Florida</b></p>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_tortoise" target="_blank">Galapagos tortoise</a></li>
	<p><b>The Gal치pagos tortoise complex or Gal치pagos giant tortoise complex is a species complex of 15 (13 extant and 2 extinct) very large tortoise species in the genus Chelonoidis (which also contains three other species from mainland South America). They are the largest living species of tortoise, with some modern Gal치pagos tortoises weighing up to 417 kg (919 lb).[3] With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, they are one of the longest-lived vertebrates. Captive Galapagos tortoises can live up to 177 years.[4] For example, a captive individual, Harriet, lived for at least 175 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish gal치pago, meaning "tortoise"</b></p>
